# Epitome
As the project title suggests, Epitome is an application which will take offline and online 
class/meeting audio as an input, convert it into a text document and will summarize the
whole discussion. Text summarization is the process of generating short, fluent, and most
importantly accurate summary of a respectively longer text document. The main idea behind
automatic text summarization is to be able to find a short subset of the most essential
information from the entire set and present it in a human-readable format. As online textual
data grows, automatic text summarization methods have potential to be very helpful because
more useful information can be read in a short time.

Since the Covid-19 Pandemic, majorly all meetings, classes, lectures, seminars and all other
forms of informative gathering has been done through online means. We all say the modern
generation is the technological influenced one, but a large shift like this is also hard for them
to swallow. Major reports have shown the attendees for the online gatherings are far less
focused then the physical meeting attendees. Epitome is a catalyst that will allow user to
become friendly with the environment by taking their burden off for creation of transcripts,
notes and summary for the online meetings.
